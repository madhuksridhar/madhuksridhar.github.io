Work experience
======
* Graduate Research Assistant at University of Alabama Huntsville  ATOM Lab (Aug 2018 – Apr 2020)
  * Supervisor: Dr. Chang-kwon Kang
  * Experimental measurement of Monarch butterfly wing and body kinematics in tethered and free flight
    * Wing and body motions measured using Vicon motion tracking cameras in the ATOM lab. Miniaturized reflective tape markers (1.8 mm dia.) so that they can be affixed on Monarch thorax and abdomen segments. Conducted experiments to record flapping, gliding, maneuvering flights inside capture volumes of various dimensions. Conducted tethered experiments to record the aerodynamic forces and wing kinematics of Monarchs with simultaneous measurement using force transducer and motion tracking cameras. Capture butterfly flight using high-speed cameras. Processed recorded data in Vicon Nexus and Tracker Software. Wrote Python/Matlab scripts to post process the experimental data.
  * Experimental investigation of flapping wing flyer (Marsbee) for Mars exploration
    * Contributed in designing the experimental setup inside a large vacuum chamber and measuring the aerodynamic forces and wing kinematics.Post processed the experimentally measured data recorded from the Vicon motion tracking system. Collaborated with fellow graduate and undergraduate students.
  * Quasi-steady aerodynamics for describing Monarch butterfly flight
    * Simulation of trajectory using quasi-steady aerodynamic model using Matlab.
  * Fluid-structure interaction of chordwise flexible Monarch wings at high altitude conditions
  * Characterization of anisotropic Monarch butterfly wing structure
    * Processed high resolution micro-CT scan of Monarch butterfly wings in NIfTI file format using Python and Paraview. Converted micro-CT scan data to STL wing models. FEM analysis of the reconstructed wing models in Solid Edge.
    
* Graduate Teaching Assistant at University of Alabama in Huntsville (Aug 2013 – Aug 2018)
  * Instructor for Principles of Measurements and Instrumentation Laboratory (8 semesters).
    * Supervisor: Dr. Daniel Armentrout
    * Lab experiments included Arduino programming, NI Virtualbench, temperature measurements, Op Amps and signal conditioning, force measurements, calibration and uncertainty analysis. Presented 15 minute introductory lecture at the beginning of each lab. Supervised students during the lab hours. Graded lab reports and projects. Assisted in training fellow lab instructors.
  * Instructor for Fundamentals of Aerodynamics Laboratory (5 semesters).
    * Supervisors: Dr. Brian Landrum, Dr. Konstantinos Kanistras, Dr. Chang-kwon Kang
    * Operated the 1×1 ft open circuit wind tunnel. As a lead instructor of the lab designed and improved experiments, tested and calibrated measurement devices, contributed in preparing lab manuals and performed overall maintenance of the wind tunnel. Presented 30 minute introductory lecture at the beginning of each lab. Assisted in training fellow lab instructors. Graded lab reports.

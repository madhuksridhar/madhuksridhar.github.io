Hello! I'm Madhu Sridhar and I recently graduated with a PhD in Mechancial Engineering from the department of [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.uah.edu/eng/departments/mae) at [University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu/). My PhD advisor was [Dr. Chang-kwon Kang](https://www.uah.edu/eng/faculty-staff/chang-kwon-kang) and my research was centered around modeling the aerodynamcis of insect flight. My PhD dissertation investigated the effects of altitude on the aerodynamics of Monarch butterflies using experimental and computational methods. One of the major applications of this research work is in the development of bio-inspired, long-range [Micro Air Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_air_vehicle). My PhD research was partly funded by [National Science Foundation (NSF) research grant](https://www.uah.edu/news/research/nsf-grant-will-help-fund-engineering-professors-research-of-bio-inspired-micro-air-vehicles). 

I earned a M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of Alabama in Huntsville in 2015. My Master's research focused on investigation of aerodynamics of flexible flapping wings at fruit fly and bumblebee scales using a Fluid Structure Interaction module for Navier-Stokes simulations. 

My research has been published in <i> AIAA Journal, Bioinspiration and Biomimetics</i>, and <i>Journal of Royal Society Interface</i>. My collaborative paper with [Dr. Chang-kwon Kang](https://butterfly.uah.edu/) and [Dr. Brian Landrum](https://www.uah.edu/eng/faculty-staff/d-brian-landrum) won the 2019 AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Graduate Student Paper Competition.

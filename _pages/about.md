# About Me

Hello, I'm a PhD student at the [Mechancial and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.uah.edu/eng/departments/mae) working with [Dr. Chang-kwon Kang](https://www.uah.edu/eng/faculty-staff/chang-kwon-kang) at [The University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu/). My PhD research investigates the effects of altitude on the aerodynamics of Monarch butterflies using experimental and computational methods. This work ultimately aims to benefit the development of bio-inspired long-range [Micro Air Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_air_vehicle). My PhD research is partly funded by [National Science Foundation (NSF) research grant](https://www.uah.edu/news/research/nsf-grant-will-help-fund-engineering-professors-research-of-bio-inspired-micro-air-vehicles). My collaborative paper with [Dr. Chang-kwon Kang](https://butterfly.uah.edu/) and [Dr. Brian Landrum](https://www.uah.edu/eng/faculty-staff/d-brian-landrum) won the 2019 AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Graduate Student Paper Competition.  

I earned M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from UAH in 2015. My Master's research focused on investigation of aerodynamics of flexible flapping wings at fruit fly and bumblebee scales using Fluid-structure interaction.

Hello, I'm a PhD student in the department of [Mechancial and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.uah.edu/eng/departments/mae) at [University of Alabama in Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu/) working with [Dr. Chang-kwon Kang](https://www.uah.edu/eng/faculty-staff/chang-kwon-kang). My PhD research investigates the effects of altitude on the aerodynamics of Monarch butterflies using experimental and computational methods. This work ultimately aims to benefit the development of bio-inspired long-range [Micro Air Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_air_vehicle). My PhD research is partly funded by [National Science Foundation (NSF) research grant](https://www.uah.edu/news/research/nsf-grant-will-help-fund-engineering-professors-research-of-bio-inspired-micro-air-vehicles). My collaborative paper with [Dr. Chang-kwon Kang](https://butterfly.uah.edu/) and [Dr. Brian Landrum](https://www.uah.edu/eng/faculty-staff/d-brian-landrum) won the 2019 AIAA Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Graduate Student Paper Competition.  

I earned M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from UAH in 2015. My Master's research focused on investigation of aerodynamics of flexible flapping wings at fruit fly and bumblebee scales using Fluid Structure interaction.
